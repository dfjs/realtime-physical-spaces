# Realtime interfaces and physical spaces - with WebSockets, Next.js and IoT

This project is the accompanying code to an article here: 

[medium.com/realtime-interfaces-and-physical-spaces-with-websockets-next-js-and-iot-e4a89d8febed](https://dfjsc.medium.com/realtime-interfaces-and-physical-spaces-with-websockets-next-js-and-iot-e4a89d8febed)

The article is about a project that combines various technologies and concepts to create a physical user experience using [Gravio, an IoT Edge platform](https://www.gravio.com/en) and a custom Next.js (a React.js framework) setup, with WebSockets and HTTP APIs.

This [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
